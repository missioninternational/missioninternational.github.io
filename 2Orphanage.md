>Greetings Al,<br>
>I am so grateful for you, your family and ministry keep rendering for the kids and the entire home. I'm receiving the finances you send. The orphanage is growing day after day. Presently we have thirteen pigs and twenty-four piglets. We've in total twenty five chickens, unfortunately seven have died. We have four laying eggs presently...It's a wonderful season indeed after so many periods of darkness. So the kids are in the school buildings and is presently operating classes from nursery-seven grade. God Bless you. <br>It's Mama Cooper
