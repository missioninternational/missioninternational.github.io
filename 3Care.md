>Dear Brother Al Schirduan, We appreciate all financial assistances from every Staff, Employee, Authority and Sympathizer of Roper Hospital. The money is used to help the most victims and their bereaved families for the purchase of cartons of hand washing soap, chloral and tide soap, juices, essential detergents and first aid drugs followed by petit cash for food and laundry. Seven quarantined homes out of 81 have benefited from your assistances. Pls. expect a genuine receipt and current photos in process as soon as possible. Mama Cooper has finalized a schedule with us to teach the SRT/ABST. to the orphanage homes. I will get ready to start in a week from now after I conclude the Parent sections of SRT workshop begun since weeks ago. <br> ---  Pastor John Wologo of Narepa Pastoral Ministries
