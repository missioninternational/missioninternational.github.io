            <p class="light"><strong>Silver Ring Thing</strong> is a ministry that defies the norms of culture and speaks honestly to teens about sex and relationships. Through a high-impact event of comedy, drama, music, videos and testimonies, SRT shows teens that purity is much more than waiting until a wedding day. It’s a commitment to persevere, a pursuit of freedom that enables you to embrace healthy relationships free of confusion, brokenness and pain. It is keeping your mind, body and spirit focused on Jesus and pursuing a life that honors him. It’s an inspiring message that promotes real and lasting change. </p>

            <p class="light">Towards the end of our Mission trip to Africa our director stated that an orphange near Monrovia had children dying with no one to help.  Their well pump had broken and they resorted to drinking infected water.  We were able to bring medicine and fix the pump and fell in love with Mama Cooper's Orphange.  Babies would be left on her door step growing the need regularly. We have since monthly supported her amazing ministry of provision and love.  We have built three buildings, outhouses and provided pigs and chickens.</p>
