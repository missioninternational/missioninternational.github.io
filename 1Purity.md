#### Be Free! 

**Sexual Purity is a critical key to a successful Christian Life.**

[Silver Ring Thing](https://www.silverringthing.com/) is presenting a fantastic program at Cathedral of Praise Church on March 7th at 6pm. Our culture is so calloused to the value of sex. The lies promising freedom have come with a cost and our pursuit of pleasure has caused much pain.  Our 'right' without responsibility has left many betrayed, abused and broken.

We are created for so much more... There is a truth that shouts, “If you knew who you are and whose you are, you would desire to live differently.” It's time to break ties from the lies and find freedom in the truth.

"How can a young person stay on the path of purity? By living according to your word.” - Psalm 119:9

Included with this event is a separate Parent Session which informs parents about the real attitudes and behaviors of today's youth culture and how you can best support their child's commitment to purity. 87% of teens say it would be easier to postpone sexual activity and avoid teen pregnancy if they were able to have more open, honest conversations with their parents. This session offers timeless answers and foundational truths for parents who want the best for their kids.

**Parent Session topics include:**

- The role of parents in the abstinence decision
- The news you haven’t heard
- Debunking the ‘Safe-sex’ myth
- 8 key things every parent should do… and so much more!
