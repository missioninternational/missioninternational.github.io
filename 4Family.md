Reaching out to touch the less fortunate is difficult especially when you are less fortunate yourself.  This is why supporting Pastor Lubwama is so important.  His ministry to provide food, shelter and love to battered mothers and children is at the heart of our Lords commission.

**Our latest letter to Pastor John in Liberia:**

>Hello Pastor and a Happy Loving New Year to you, your family and all in the ministry. Thank you for asking, Yes, for the year of 2018 the Lord has put on my heart an aspiration to promote “Faithful Fathers”. Families are in such great spiritual need and the Bible is clear that men, like yourself, must advance the fight for sexual purity and leadership. The vision is....Faithful Fathers for God(personal, daily relationship), Faithful Fathers for the family(wife and children) and Faithful Fathers for the community(church, neighborhoods and politics). <br><br>More than ever, true Christians are in a battle with the culture surrounding us. We as Christian men need to be on the forefront of battling immorality, dishonesty and selfishness in ourselves and in our community. Too long we have been so careful not to offend others that we have allowed evil to prosper around us. A famous man, Edmond Burke has said, “All it takes for evil to win is for good men to do nothing.” Now is the time, Pastor John, for good men to link arms in a loving, spiritual battle. This is especially true with sexual immorality. But it is also time to firmly stand against forces that promote evil in all areas of our lives and nation. <br><br>I believe God's heart is to see Fathers no longer being slaves but to be set free. John 8:34, “Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the SLAVE of sin.”  So as I have said, let us fight the good fight and run the true race. Let us set aside the sin that so easily besets us. Let us step into all God has created us to be and become Champions for the King of Kings! Thank you again pastor for all you are doing. God Bless!
